Site Builder builds my site at Netlify the same as I can build it on my local machine.

Studio does a pretty decent job trying to parse the site and helping me edit it pnce I navigate to a pgae ... except:

* I get the orange eternal triple-dot problem on my first edit
* Studio never actually shows me the re-render of the pages I'm clearly editing when I look at the GitHub side.  Even after I "publish" the changes (and yes, the changes go to Netlify -- just still don't show up in Studio).
